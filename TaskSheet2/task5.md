# Finite difference approximations

The most interesting thing that I learned was the tie back to linear algebra. Ordinary differential equations and partial differential equations into system equations that caan be solved with a matrix (see [introduction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_difference_method#Example:_The_Laplace_operator)). One thing, I saw that was interesting was how they use the [method of undetermined coefficients](https://archive.siam.org/books/ot98/sample/OT98Chapter1.pdf) to derive appropriate approximations using Taylor series. 
One example of using the finite difference method was for the [explicit heat equation](http://geodynamics.usc.edu/~becker/teaching/557/problem_sets/problem_set_fd_explicit.pdf).
