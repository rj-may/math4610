**Routine Name:**           vecOps: vecAdd, vecSub, dotProd, outerProd

**Author:** Riley May

**Language:** python

**Description/Purpose:** This program calculates various vector operations. Those are vector addition (vecAdd), vector subtraction
(vecSub),dot product (dotProd), and outer product (outerProd).

**Input:** The input for this program is two differente vectors. In the case of the dot product and outer product they need 
to be vectors of the same size. 
It is important to note that the vector

**Output:** 
For vector addition and subtraction it outputs 

**Usage/Example:**

The routine has two arguments needed to return the values of the precision in terms of the smallest number that can be
represented. Since the code is written in terms of a Fortran subroutine, the values of the machine machine epsilon and
the power of two that gives the machine epsilon. Due to implicit Fortran typing, the first argument is a single precision
value and the second is an integer.

      call smaceps(sval, ipow)
      print *, ipow, sval

Output from the lines above:

      24   5.96046448E-08

The first value (24) is the number of binary digits that define the machine epsilon and the second is related to the
decimal version of the same value. The number of decimal digits that can be represented is roughly eight (E-08 on the
end of the second value).

**Implementation/Code:** The following is the code for smaceps()

      subroutine smaceps(seps, ipow)
    c
    c set up storage for the algorithm
    c --------------------------------
    c
          real seps, one, appone
    c
    c initialize variables to compute the machine value near 1.0
    c ----------------------------------------------------------
    c
          one = 1.0
          seps = 1.0
          appone = one + seps
    c
    c loop, dividing by 2 each time to determine when the difference between one and
    c the approximation is zero in single precision
    c --------------------------------------------- 
    c
          ipow = 0
          do 1 i=1,1000
             ipow = ipow + 1
    c
    c update the perturbation and compute the approximation to one
    c ------------------------------------------------------------
    c
            seps = seps / 2
            appone = one + seps
    c
    c do the comparison and if small enough, break out of the loop and return
    c control to the calling code
    c ---------------------------
    c
            if(abs(appone-one) .eq. 0.0) return
    c
        1 continue
    c
    c if the code gets to this point, there is a bit of trouble
    c ---------------------------------------------------------
    c
          print *,"The loop limit has been exceeded"
    c
    c done
    c ----
    c
          return
    end
